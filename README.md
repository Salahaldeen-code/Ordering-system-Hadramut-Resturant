**Project Description
**

Bandar Hadramout Restaurant, renowned for its Yemeni and Arab cuisine, has faced challenges with its manual ordering system, leading to order delays and customer dissatisfaction. This project develops a web-based restaurant management system to automate the ordering process, ensuring efficiency and reducing human errors. Key functionalities include order management, table management, and real-time sales analytics, aimed at improving service delivery and operational management.

**Problem Definition
**

The restaurant's manual system often results in long customer wait times and order-related mistakes due to poor communication between the waitstaff and kitchen staff. This project replaces the outdated system with a robust digital solution that facilitates better customer interaction and operational control.
